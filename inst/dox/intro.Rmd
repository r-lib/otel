OpenTelemetry is an observability framework. [OpenTelemetry](
  https://opentelemetry.io/) is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs
used to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data such
as metrics, logs, and traces, for analysis in order to understand
your software's performance and behavior.

For an introduction to OpenTelemetry, see the [OpenTelemetry website
  docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/).

To learn how to instrument your R code, see [Getting Started](`r gslink`).
